- Restoration Games appears to be doing booth demos rather than scheduled events
- Many Reiner Knizia events found in the 298000 series event IDs
- Brass: Birmingham has multiple events including training sessions and tournaments
- Many events appear to be custom booth crawls or special activities rather than official Gen Con events
- Some events may be workshops, seminars, or special presentations that might not have traditional event IDs
- Tournament events and designer meet & greets often have specific event IDs
